intro: "It's been a long time coming for me to finally watch this movie. It was advertised before so many of my library vhs rentals and yet I never could find it. But I knew from a young age that I wanted to see this movie...and then promptly forgot to follow up until decades later. Here is my mini shrine in dedication to my first watch through."
