intro: "My first webring I joined is from one of my favorite long time media series - Nancy Drew PC games. And while I love them and will replay them at the drop of a hat, there in fact exists a much bigger Nancy fan than I, my little sister. A few holidays ago she gifted me a labor of love - a Nancy Drew themed cooked book with recipes to go along with gameplay of your favorite game. I wanted to share this A. Because it was a genius idea and B. use this as a scheme to meet new nancy fans. Let's dig in!"

**disclaimer** *when my sister made this for me she had no intention of sharing this publicly so she didn't bother to write down her sources which is completely valid. I will do my best to try to back search some of these recipes but there's a good chance I won't be able to find the original sources.*

### Instructions


1.  Slice the potatoes into ½ inch thick sticks. Soak the potato slices in cold water for a minimum of one hour, and up to overnight. The longer, the better as this process removes the starch which makes for extra crispy fries.
    
2.  After soaking, rinse the fries twice with cold water and lay the fries on paper towels or a clean dishcloth. Pat them as dry as possible.
    
3.  Heat oil in a large sauce pot or dutch oven to 300 degrees F. You’ll need to fry in about six batches, begin with a quart of oil and add more as needed. Frying too many at once makes them less crispy.
    
4.  Use a slotted spoon to add the potatoes to the oil and fry for about 5-6 minutes. The oil should bubble lightly as it’s only heating the potatoes for now.
    
5.  Place the cooked potatoes on a paper towel lined plate and fry the rest of the remaining batches.
    
6.  Increase the heat to 400 degrees F and fry each batch a second time until they are crisp and golden-brown, about 5 minutes or so.
    
7.  Remove them and place them on dry paper towels. Sprinkle them with salt as soon as they come out.
    
8.  If using an oven to cook, place the fries in a single layer on a baking sheet at 400° F in the lower-third of the oven for 15-20 minutes. Then, remove, toss, place in a single layer, and bake for 10 more minutes or until brown and crispy.
    
### REMASTERED Dipping Sauce:

In a small bowl combine 1 cup mayonnaise, ¾ cup ketchup, 1 TSP Worcestershire sauce, 1 TBSP pickle brine, 1 TSP paprika, and a pinch of cayenne. Serve with your fries.
