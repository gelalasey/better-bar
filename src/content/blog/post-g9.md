You’ve finally escaped city life and moved to the sleepy town of Riverview. Here you can finally live the life you’ve always dreamed of. You really want to become a farmer. Fruits, vegetables, chickens, cows! You want it all. Will you be able to find peace in Riverview?' "

Welcome to the farm Jaime! This sim is the start of the store world legacy challenge with nothing to his name but a few simoleans and a preoccupation with nature. He spent his first Summer in Riverview trying to set himself up a farm with fresh summer vegetables, herbs, fruits, and even a honey hive. But plants aren’t the only thing growing for Jaime, he’s also bend tending to the cultivation of friends near and wide.

One sim in particular that connected well was Luke McDermont, a fellow farmer with a love for the outdoors and nature. After several local gatherings at Luke’s (often attended just to get out of the rain), the two became inseparable. They would often trade gardening tips or go fishing for great fertilizers. Although he was much older, Luke enjoyed advising a young new farmer on the ways of the land…including unsavory people to stay away from such as Don Lothario. But will Jaime be dissuaded from hanging out with another young single guy?
