intro: "I really am trying to publish these once a day, I could just mass post them all, but then I won't be able to unlock my daily habit of blogging a little bit every day. Why is that important? idk something something self-expression, habit chaining, etc. etc. But most importantly I have this cookbook sitting on my desk and I'm not allowed to take it off until I finish typing up and publishing all these recipes. and ya boy is DETERMINED to finish. clutter on my desk? boo hiss and begone. Anyway let's get into the mhm recipe "

**disclaimer** *when my sister made this for me she had no intention of sharing this publicly so she didn't bother to write down her sources which is completely valid. I will do my best to try to back search some of these recipes but there's a good chance I won't be able to find the original sources.*

### Instructions


1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Grease two 9x13 inch baking sheets.
2. In a medium bowl, lightly beat the egg white, vanilla extract, almond extract, and vegetable oil until frothy, but not stiff.
3. Sift the flour, cornstarch, salt, and sugar in a separate bowl. Stir the water into the flour mixture.
4. Add the flour to the egg white mixture and stir until you have a smooth batter. The batter should not be runny but should drop easily off a wooden spoon.
5. Place level tablespoons of batter onto the cookie sheet, spacing them at least 3 inches apart. Gently tilt the baking sheet back and forth and from side to side so that each tablespoon of batter forms into a circle 4 inches in diameter.
6. Bake until the outer 1/2-inch of each cookie turns golden brown, and they are easy to remove from the baking sheet with a spatula (14 to 15 minutes).
7. Working quickly, remove the cookie with a spatula and flip it over in your hand.
8. Place a fortune in the middle of a cookie.
9. To form the fortune cookie shape, fold the cookie in half, then gently pull the edges downward over the rim of a glass, wooden spoon or the edge of a muffin tin. Place the finished cookie in the cup of a muffin tin so that it keeps its shape. 
10. Allow to set until cool and the cookie holds its shape.
