intro: "Happy boxing day world! I hope you celebrated at least by doing something this week that brings you joy. I've been feeling the holiday blues like hell this year, alas it's my burnout cycle curse. But what if we made it a little better by thinking about two of my favorite topics - retro video games and snacks. I hope this sweet treat is enjoyable pairing for STFD. Ironically I STILL haven't played this game - it's almost a point of pride now. But lucky for you this is my sister's recipes and not mine so it's gotta be authentic!"

# Stay Tuned For Bomb-Bons
These tampered chocolates might just blast you into your first TV role. Also makes great leftovers to re-use when out of ideas for later games recipes.

**disclaimer** *when my sister made this for me she had no intention of sharing this publicly so she didn't bother to write down her sources which is completely valid. I will do my best to try to back search some of these recipes but there's a good chance I won't be able to find the original sources.*

### Instructions


1. In a large bowl, combine confectioners' sugar, pecans, milk and butter. 
2. Roll into 1-in. balls. Place on waxed paper-lined baking sheets. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
3. In a microwave, melt chocolate chips and shortening; stir until smooth. Or, you can melt the chocolate over the stovetop using the double boiler method. Place chocolate and shortening in a heatproof bowl that fits over your pot of simmering water, and continue to stir the chocolate until it’s melty. 
4. Remove balls from the fridge and test firmness. If balls are too soft to dip, freezer until firm, 3-5 minutes.
5. Dip balls in chocolate; allow excess to drip off. Place on waxed paper; let stand until set.
6. These chocolate bonbons do need to be refrigerated, so keep in mind you will lose some glossiness due to the chill. Keep them in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 5 days.
