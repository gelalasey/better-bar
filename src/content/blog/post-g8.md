intro: "With a massive amount of time off around the holidays - I'm finally available to participate in my favorite longform time waster. The Sims has held a special place in my heart since the launch of TS1 - yup I'm that old. I've grown up with this game throughout decades of my life. One taught me love (ts2) One taught me patience (ts3) and one taught me pain (do you even need to guess which one). But in my years of playing this game there's one thing I haven't been able to conquer - and that's a legacy challenge. I think the most I've ever made it through was about 4 or 5 generations when I did the decades challenge. But then I got my 1950's heir hooked on diet pills and the save file got too unhinged at that point."

So for my dive back into legacy play throughs I decided to do something a little more adhd friendly, the store worlds challenge created by [florydaax](https://www.tumblr.com/florydaax/701017236676149248/the-sims-3-store-world-legacy). I figured moving towns every generation would help ease the boredom of feeling stuck in one spot. I could create my ideal home in each neighborhood before leaving it behind. This challenge will have 11 generations to get through in order of release date. In this challenge each generation is in charge of making a name for themselves in every store world neighborhood. They want to assimilate into the community but also leave their mark on it. Each generation is called by something specific of the world only to find success and failure within in it. 

Because I struggle to get through these, I decided to make some custom rules from both the original legacy challenge and some options from my own game play to help me feel like I'm not just rushing through to complete goals. In this game I must adhere to the following conditions:

1. Founder must move into 345 Riverblossom Hills Drive in order to start with proper money.
2. The heir can only be decided once all required children have been born. All children are given random traits as they go through life until the heir is decided. The heir is selected from all children eligible to obtain all 5 traits (aka they can’t have anything that directly opposes them like hates kids vs loves kids). From all potential heirs one is selected by random. 
3. Sims can only be aged up once the game prompts you with a reminder of their impending birthday
4. You begin the next generation once the next heir reaches young adulthood. They may take with this 5% of the current household funds for every point earned by the previous heir (e.g. 7 points earned = 35%)
5. Sims may only be brought back from the dead in relevant generation where it is a goal, otherwise you cannot consume life fruit, death flowers or ambrosia
6. The following lifetime rewards can’t be claimed: 
    1. Inheritance
    2. Dusty Old Lamp
    3. Immortal
    4. Age Freeze
    5. Moodlet Manager – You can zap non-family Sims with it if you like, but you cannot use it on your Legacy family Sims unless they are spares and move out and are no longer in the main playable family.
    6. Clone Voucher is allowed but cannot earn the family any points
7. Sims identified as “rich” are not allowed to move in specifically with the founder
8. Once a sim is moved out of the legacy household they may not move back in

Okay but how are the points determined? This is done mostly by the original legacy challenge rules again but here they are listed for us lazy folk. 

| Event      | Max Possible      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| New generation starts | 1 |
| Lifetime want fulfilled per family member in house | Household # |
| Portrait, Book, sculpture, or level 4 photograph or sim | YA+ Sims on Lot # |
| Every $100,000 in net worth earned | n/a |
| Every 100,000 points worth of aspiration rewards | 2 |
| Trait obtained by heir that matches their generation| 5 |

And that's about it - I'll be playing on regular lifespan settings however I'll be extending the seasons to 2 weeks because I hate back to back holidays. Each chapter (blog post) will be one season. Let's see if im capable of finishing more or less remembing to log and post. 

Allons-y yall!
